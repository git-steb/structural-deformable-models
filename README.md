Classification of ant species in macro-photographic images
==========================================================

Implementation of the image analysis system described in
Steven Bergner's thesis work on ["Deformable structural models"][bergner2003ants],
also published at IEEE ICIP 2004.

Algorithm
---------

The system involves feature detection layers with convolutions and non-linear functions of the underlying color image data input.

A combination of stochastic search and local gradient descent with damping
is used to optimize a graphical model of shape components that finds connections among
maxima in the feature detection sensor layer and compares them to dynamically adjustable models of different ant species.

An overview of the main classes implemented in the ``src`` folder is given in
Chapter 5 of the thesis ["Structural Deformable Models for Robust Object Recognition"
on page 61 (p. 81 in the PDF)](https://stevenbergner.github.io/assets/pub/thesis_bergner03.pdf "diploma thesis PDF file").

Also have a look at the ["auto-generated documentation"](https://git-steb.github.io/structural-deformable-models/).

INSTALLATION 
------------

After adjusting build paths and compiler options in src/Makebundle/pre.make and lib.make run

    ./download-externals.sh
    cd src
    make -j4

to obtain a build of the deform binary in a architecture specific subfolder, e.g. ``src/obj/LINUX_debug/``.

Libraries and external source code that is required to build and run the application:

* FOX toolkit (build with ``./configure  --with-opengl``)
* FFTW3
* Eigen3
* currently deactivated EPS export: camgraph
* System installation of libglut and libGL is required. Also, libfreetype6-dev, etc.

Some of the package installations to compile using ``cd src; make -j4`` on Ubuntu 16.04:

    sudo apt install libfox-1.6-dev
    sudo apt install libpng-dev
    sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev
    sudo apt install libxft-dev
    ...

INSTALLATION - Data
-------------------

The algorithm works on image data, e.g., as collected by [MCZ at Harvard Entomology](insects.oeb.harvard.edu/mcz/ "database website").
Download of macro-photographic image data for personal use or research, or whichever type of usage permitted by the database website, can be done using a script (TODO) and wget.
